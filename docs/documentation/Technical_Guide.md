## 1. Overview

Glovesy is an Arduino based wearable device which allows the user to interface with their computer, either by using user-defined macros, which will be set up using our program, the Glovesy Configuration Suite, which will allow several gestures to be defined to certain actions within the PC or by allowing the user accurate hand and finger tracking for use in Virtual and Augmented Reality.

Gestures are defined by the user and mapped to some action on their PC. Actions can include entering a combination of keystrokes, opening an application, raising/ lowering system volume, etc. They are executed upon the user repeating their chosen gesture.
